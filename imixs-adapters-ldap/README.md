# LDAP Adapter

This adapter module provides a set of services and plug-ins to be used to lookup user meta data form a LDAP directory.
The Services and Plug-ins are connected to a LDAP service either directly or by using a JNDI connector (to be configured on the application server).

## Activation

The LDAP Services are automatically activated in case the module is included in the application classpath.

## Configuration

The LDAP connection can either be configured as a JNDI Ressource with the name `org.imixs.ldap.directory` on the application server or in the `imixs.properties` file.

Die Search Configuration erfolgt Ã¼ber die `imixs.properties` Datei

### External Configuration File

The LDAP configuration can also be configured in an external configuration file (e.g. in a Container environment). The location of this file can be defined by a environment variable named `LDAP_LOOKUP_CONFIG`. If no external config file exists, the configuration is read from the `imixs.properties` file.

### Direct Server Lookup

In case the connection to the LDAP server is not defined by a JNDI resource the configuration follows the `java.naming` parameters. See the following example:

    # host and credentials
    java.naming.provider.url=ldap://localhost:389
    java.naming.security.principal=CN=bind_user,CN=users,DC=company,DC=de
    java.naming.security.credentials=password

### User Attributes

The property ldap.user-attributes provides a list of ldap attributes to be stored in the corresponding User Profile document. The attributes are comma separated. Optional a target-fieldname can be defined by | followed by the document item:

    ldap.user-attributes=uid,SN,CN,mail|txtEmail

This example will store the data of the attribute 'mail' into the item with the name 'txtEmail'.

## The LDAPLookupService

The EJB LDAPLookupService provides methods to fetch data from the LDAP service. This can be either user data or group information where a user is member of.

### Caching

The LDAP Lookup service is using an internal cache. The cache size and cache duration is defined by the imixs.properties

    ldap.cache-expires=3600000
    ldap.cache-size=100

Note: A system-check form the web-front-end did discard the ProfileService cache, but not the ldapLookupService cache. This means to discard the ldap cache you can either wait for the ldap.cach-expires period or you can restart the application.

## Lookup LDAP Context

The ldap context can either be injected by a JNDI name or constructed manually based on a given configuration:

### JNDI Lookup

For the jndi lookup the 'ldap.disable-jndi' is set to 'false' or omitted. The ldap context is read form the JNDI name 'ldap.jndi-name'. See the following configuration example:

    ldap.disable-jndi=false
    ldap.jndi-name=mycontext

### Manually lookup

To connect directyl to the ldap service the following properties must be defined in the imixs.properties file:

    ldap.disable-jndi=true
    java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
    java.naming.security.authentication=simple

Additional parameters can be set by defining property keys starting with 'java.naming'. See the following example:

    java.naming.provider.url=ldap://127.0.0.1:389
    java.naming.security.principal=user
    java.naming.security.credentials=password

### Microsoft Active Directory

To connect to a Microsoft Active Directory the follwoing additonal addributes can be set optional:

    java.naming.referral=follow
    java.naming.ldap.version=2

A userid lookup is typically made against the AD attribute 'samAccountName' using the following search phrase:

    (samAccountName=%u)

## The LDAPProfileEvent

The LdapLookupService sends the CDI Event 'org.imixs.workflow.ldap.LDAPProfileEvent'. This event can be observed by CDI classes to adapt the content of a fetched ldap user profile.

See the following example:

    @Stateless
    public class CustomLDAPProfileAdapter {
    	public void onEvent(@Observes LDAPProfileEvent event) {
    		ItemCollection profile = event.getProfile();
    		// set a custom profile attribute ....
    		.....
    		profile.replaceItemValue("txtusernameCustom", special_username);
    		event.setProfile(profile);
    	}
    }

## The Marty ProfileEvent

The Imixs-Marty ProfileService sends the CDI event '_org.imixs.marty.ejb.ProfileEvent_' during the creation and the lookup of a profile object. The event is observed by the LDAPLookupService to enrich a profile with attributes from an LDAP object.

### ON_PROFILE_LOOKUP

The event type 'ON_PROFILE_LOOKUP' is send by the ProfileService in case a local lookup for a profile failed. This means no profile document exists in the workflow instance. In this situation the LDAPLookupService lookups the profile data in the LDAP directory and returns a corresponding ItemCollection. The profile is not saved in the database but cached in the local LDAPCache.

### ON_PROFILE_CREATE

The event type 'ON_PROFILE_CREATE' is send immediately before a profile object is created. The attributes of the profile are updated by LDAPLookupService with the defined user attributes.

## The LDAPPlugin

The LDAPPlugin can be used in the system model to update a user profile when processed with the data stored in the LDAP directory.

    org.imixs.workflow.ldap.LDAPPlugin

The plugin runs on Profile Entities only. The plugin makes a ldap lookup and updates all items defined by he property ldap.user-attributes

## LDAP User Input Controller

As an alternative to the Marty UserInputController this project provides a generic `LDAPUserInputController` implementation. This CDI bean can be used as an alternative to the Marty UserInputController. It allows to search for names, even if there are no profiles created for them yet. The class is only used for the name search in user input fields from the [imixs-marty project](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-marty)! The controller can be declared as a replacement for the class `org.imixs.marty.profile.UserInputController` by adding the CDI Bean as an alternative defined in the `beans.xml`:

```xml
...
    <alternatives>
        <class>org.imixs.workflow.ldap.LDAPUserInputController</class>
    </alternatives>
...
```

### Filter Phrase

The default filter phrase is defined by the following LDAP expression:

```
(& (|(objectClass=user)(objectClass=person)) (mail=*) (|(name=?*)(mail=?*)(cn=?*)(sn=?*)))")
```

This is filter phrase is useful for most cases. It can be overwritten by setting the property value `ldap.search-filter-phrase` in the ldap.properties file. See the section 'configuration' above.

## The LDAP Group Interceptor

The interceptor class

    org.imixs.workflow.ldap.LDAPGroupInterceptor

is used to provide the user access management with user groups provided by an external ldap directory. The interceptor class can be configured in the ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor:

    ...
    <assembly-descriptor>
    	<!-- LDAPGroupInterceptor -->
    	<interceptor-binding>
    	    <description>Intercepter to add ldap attributes into the profile context</description>
    	    <ejb-name>ProfileService</ejb-name>
    		<interceptor-class>org.imixs.workflow.ldap.LDAPGroupInterceptor</interceptor-class>
    	</interceptor-binding>
    </assembly-descriptor>
    ...

The configuration to lookup a user is done by the imixs.properties.
