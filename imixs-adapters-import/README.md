# Import Adapter

The Imixs Import Adapter is a generic import adapter service to be used to import documents form various sources. An import scheduler sends CDI events to be processed by specific import observers. The following import sources are supported:

 - FTP - import form a ftp server 
 - IMAP - import form an email box via IMAP
 
 
# Scheduling

The Imixs DocumentImportScheduler uses a calendar-based syntax for scheduling based on the EJB 3.1 Timer Service specification. The syntax takes its roots from the Unix cron utility. This is an example to run the scheduler all 15 minutes


	minute=*/15
	hour=*


## The Source Objects

Each source object provides at least the following properties to be used by a observer implementation:

 - server - server address including protocol
 - port - optional server port
 - user - optional user id to access the server
 - password
 - task - the task id a new workitem is assigned to
 - event - the event id a new workitem is processed 
 - workflowgroup - the workflow group the new workitem should be assigend to
 - modelversion - optional modelversion the new workitem is assigend to
 - selector - an optional selector to specify the source (e.g. a path on a ftp server)
 
 
 ### Options
 
 A source object can provide additional options provided in the item 'options'. The DocumentImportService provides a a convenient method to get a Properties object for all options:
 
	// get properties form source object
	Properties properties = documentImportService.getOptionsProperties(ItemCollection source);
    

 
## The Web UI
